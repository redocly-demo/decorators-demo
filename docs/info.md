What the ~~overlay~~ override!

Overlays are in a "proposal" stage.
They have been in discussion since 2016.

Overrides are real. See them here and now.

They work with Swagger 2.0, OpenAPI 3.0, and OpenAPI 3.1.

## Hello world

I'm using a decorator instead of an overlay because overlays do not exist.

## APIs

- See the original by toggling the version switcher.
